## Why LegoGPT?

> TLDR - My personal [Lit-GPT](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litgpt/tree/main)

While there are more advanced repositories like xformers and transformers, the question remains: why create LegoGPT? An analogy can shed light on thisâ€”consider the coexistence of search engines like Bing, You.com, DuckDuckGo, alongside the dominant Google search. Just as users choose different search engines based on their preferences, LegoGPT offers a similar choice in the realm of repositories, catering to various personal use cases.
